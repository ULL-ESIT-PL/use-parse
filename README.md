# use-parse

Very simplistic executable that dynamically `requires` a module generated by PEG.js or Jison
or any parser-parser that exports an object with a `parse` method and calls it
with the `input` provideid in the command line 

```
$ use-parse calculator '2*3'
Processing <2*3>
[ 6 ]
[ [ 6 ], {} ]
```
